My name is Augusto, but most of my friends call me Guga. I'm a general Software Engineer with a strong background working with Data Science and end to end ML applications. I've been working with data science for nearly 4 years now. My goal is to apply AI and Machine learning in real-world problems. Most of my background was working with data science/analysis, dataviz, Machine Learning models (Classical ML and Deep Learning), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Python frameworks(Flask/Django), Cloud(GCP), SQL(Postgresql) and No SQL(Redis and Cassandra) databases .

In these 4 years in the field, I've worked with Remote Sensing and Agriculture, Natural Language Processing for Word Sense Disambiguation and Fault Detection in Industrial Systems
